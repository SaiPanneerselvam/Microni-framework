# Microni Framework
The Microni Framework is an open-source framework for OpenBlack Development Purposes. This can be used for making a specific virtual Single-App Virtual Disk (SAVD) type using our or 3rd party SAVD Makers. This runs OT23 for open source teapackage repositories (look at teapackage.md). 
To use the Microni Framework shell to create an SAVD is a little bit more complex than using a normal drive. [Look here (howtocreatewithshell.md) on looking more into how to make the SAVD on the shell](url)
